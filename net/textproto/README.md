# Text Protocol

The general term for parsing and serializing is "Data Marshalling" or just "Marshalling". 

This is an abstraction of Textproto for reading and writing sinple text messages over a connection.

- **Parsing** is the process of converting data in a specific format (like JSON, XML, etc.) into a format that your program can use, such as a data structure or object. This is also known as "unmarshalling" or "deserialization".

- **Serializing** is the process of converting a data structure or object in your program into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as a JSON or XML string. This is also known as "marshalling".

Together, these processes are used to convert data between formats, often for the purposes of storage, transmission over a network, or communication between different parts of a program.
