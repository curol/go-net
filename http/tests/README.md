# tests

## Mock
Mocking HTTP requests is a common practice in unit testing where you simulate an HTTP request to test your application's response without actually making a network call. The way you do this can vary depending on the language and the libraries you're using. 

Here's an example of how you might do this in Node.js using a library called `nock`:

```javascript
const nock = require('nock');
const myApp = require('./myApp');

test('mocks a post request', async () => {
  nock('http://myapp.com')
    .post('/api', { id: 1 })
    .reply(200, { status: 'ok' });

  const response = await myApp.makePostRequest();

  expect(response.status).toEqual('ok');
});
```

In this example, `nock` intercepts all POST requests to 'http://myapp.com/api' with a body of `{ id: 1 }` and responds with a 200 status and a body of `{ status: 'ok' }`. The `myApp.makePostRequest` function would then receive this mocked response.

In Go, you can use the `httptest` package to create a test server and then make requests to that server. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"testing"
)

func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "", nil)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()

	hf := http.HandlerFunc(HelloWorldHandler)

	hf.ServeHTTP(recorder, req)

	if status := recorder.Code; status != http.StatusOK {
		t.Errorf("handler returned wrong status code: got %v want %v",
			status, http.StatusOK)
	}

	expected := `Hello, world!`
	actual := recorder.Body.String()
	if actual != expected {
		t.Errorf("handler returned unexpected body: got %v want %v",
			actual, expected)
	}
}
```

In this Go example, `httptest.NewRecorder` creates a new response recorder which acts as the target of an HTTP response (i.e., it implements `http.ResponseWriter`). We then create a new HTTP request with `http.NewRequest` and pass it to our handler function. We can then check the HTTP status code and body that our handler function writes to the response recorder.
